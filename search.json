    "section": "",
    "text": "Discrete-event simulation (DES) is a widely used computational method in health services and health economic studies. This scoping review investigates to what extent authors share DES models and audits if sharing adheres to best practice. The Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ACM Digital Library databases were searched between January 1 2019 till December 31 2022. Cost-effectiveness, health service research and methodology studies in a health context were included. Data extraction and audit were performed by two reviewers. We measured the proportion of literature that shared models; we report analyses by publication type, year of publication, COVID-19 application; and free and open source versus commercial software. Out of the 564 studies included, 47 (8.3%) cited a published computer model, rising to 9.0% in 2022. Studies were more likely to share models if they had been developed using free and open source tools. Studies rarely followed best practice when sharing computer models. Although still in the minority, healthcare DES authors are increasingly sharing their computer model artefacts. Although commercial software dominates the DES literature, free and open source software plays a crucial role in sharing. The DES community can adopt simple best practices to improve the quality of sharing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives This study aimed to develop a simulation model to support orthopaedic elective capacity planning.\nMethods An open-source, generalisable discrete-event simulation was developed, including a web-based application. The model used anonymised patient records between 2016 and 2019 of elective orthopaedic procedures from a National Health Service (NHS) Trust in England. In this paper, it is used to investigate scenarios including resourcing (beds and theatres) and productivity (lengths of stay, delayed discharges and theatre activity) to support planning for meeting new NHS targets aimed at reducing elective orthopaedic surgical backlogs in a proposed ring-fenced orthopaedic surgical facility. The simulation is interactive and intended for use by health service planners and clinicians.\nResults A higher number of beds (65–70) than the proposed number (40 beds) will be required if lengths of stay and delayed discharge rates remain unchanged. Reducing lengths of stay in line with national benchmarks reduces bed utilisation to an estimated 60%, allowing for additional theatre activity such as weekend working. Further, reducing the proportion of patients with a delayed discharge by 75% reduces bed utilisation to below 40%, even with weekend working. A range of other scenarios can also be investigated directly by NHS planners using the interactive web app.\nConclusions The simulation model is intended to support capacity planning of orthopaedic elective services by identifying a balance of capacity across theatres and beds and predicting the impact of productivity measures on capacity requirements. It is applicable beyond the study site and can be adapted for other specialties."

Crucially, unclear reporting makes it difficult to reproduce or reuse findings. In this paper, we review the evidence on the quality of model reporting and consolidate previous work.

In healthcare research, where simulation models are commonly used, we see few applications of models that can easily be deployed by other researchers or by healthcare stakeholders. Models are treated as disposable artefacts, developed to deliver a set of results, and rarely address deployment for model reuse. We propose one potential solution to deploying free and open-source simulations using containerisation with continuous integration. A container provides a self-contained environment that encapsulates the model and all its required dependencies including the operating system, software, and packages. This overcomes a significant barrier to sharing models developed in open-source software, which is dependency management. Isolating the environment in a container ensures that the simulation model behaves the same way across different computing environments. It also means that other users can interact with the model without installing software, supporting both use/reuse, and reproducibility of results. We illustrate the approach using a model for orthopaedic elective recovery planning, developed with a user-friendly interface in Python, including a step-by-step approach to support M&S researchers to deploy their own models using our hybrid framework."

Despite increasing recognition of the advantages of open, reusable DES models for both healthcare practitioners and simulation researchers, in practice very few authors share their model code alongside a published paper. In the context of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), this paper presents a pilot framework called STARS: Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reusable Simulations to begin to address the challenges and leverage the opportunities of sharing DES models in healthcare. STARS aligns with existing guidelines and documentation, including reproducibility initiatives, and enables computer models to be shared with users of differing technical abilities. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of STARS with three applied DES examples using Python. Our framework supports the development of open, reusable DES models which can enable partner healthcare organisations to preview, validate, and use models. Academic research teams can benefit from knowledge exchange, enhanced recognition and scrutiny of their work, and long-term archiving of models."

Repositories and articles were also assessed against guidelines and reporting standards, offering insights into their relationship with reproducibility success. Reproducing results required up to 28 hours of troubleshooting per model, with 50% fully reproduced and 50% partially reproduced (12.5% to 94.1% of reported outcomes).
