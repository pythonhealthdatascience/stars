## GW4 Open Research Prize - Improving Quality

This research was shortlisted for the “Improving Quality” prize, which is “for those able to demonstrate that the quality of their research has been enhanced through the adoption of open research practices in their work”. You can find out more about the prize and the other [shortlisted entries and winners here](https://gw4.ac.uk/news/gw4-open-research-prize-2025-winners-announced/).

Amy presented the work at the GW4 Open Research Prize Ceremony. The [slides](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/gw4_prize_presentation/) were created using Quarto (see [slides GitHub](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/gw4_prize_presentation)).
