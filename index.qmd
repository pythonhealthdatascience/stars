![Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reproducible Simulations in healthcare](images/stars_banner.png)

This project is focused on improving the quality and impact of simulation models. Activities have helped modellers to make their models:

Reproducible

Reusable

Replicable

We're also exploring the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for supporting simulation modelling.

LLMs

We have a package to support Python simulation research.
